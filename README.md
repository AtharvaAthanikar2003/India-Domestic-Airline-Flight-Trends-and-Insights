# India Domestic Airline Flight Trends and Insights

## Description:
India's domestic aviation sector involves high traffic between cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad and Kolkata but lacks a comprehensive analysis of flight trends. 
To address this, Python was used for data analysis, and Power BI was implemented to create an interactive dashboard for data visualization. 
This project analyzed key metrics such as the longest and shortest flights, total flight counts, and maximum ticket prices, providing actionable insights that can help optimize flight schedules and pricing strategies.

## Key Achievements:
- Conducted a comprehensive analysis of domestic flight routes, identifying the longest and shortest flight paths to optimize scheduling and improve operational efficiency.
- Analyzed total flight counts and traffic trends for major domestic routes, identifying peak travel periods and high-demand routes to enhance resource allocation and route planning.
- Determined the maximum ticket price across various flight routes, revealing pricing trends and providing actionable insights to optimize pricing strategies and maximize revenue.
